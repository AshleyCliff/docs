# Contributing to documentation


## General prerequisites

There are a couple prerequisites to contributing to Charmed HPC's documentation:

* **GitHub Account** The Charmed HPC project uses GitHub to host its documentation. You will need an active GitHub account to report issues and provide contributions. See [Creating an account on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) for more details.

* **Code of Conduct** You will need to read and follow the Ubuntu [Code of Conduct](https://ubuntu.com/community/ethos/code-of-conduct). By participating, you implicitly agree to abide by the Code of Conduct.

## How to contribute

### Report an issue

To report an error in spelling, grammar, content, or documentation code functionality, [file an issue](https://github.com/charmed-hpc/docs/issues) in Charmed HPC's bug tracker on GitHub.

### Quick update or new to git

The easiest way to make a quick update, especially for those new to git and GitHub, is to use [GitHub's file editor](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files). 

:::{warning}

Make sure to chose the 'Create a **new branch** for this commit' when commiting changes. If more changes are necessary after the initial commit, they can be added in the newly created branch.

### Large contribution

For larger, more involved contributions, and those familiar with git and the commandline, follow the [fork-and-branch](https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/ process.
